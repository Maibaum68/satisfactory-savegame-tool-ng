'Satisfactory Savegame Tool NG' v0.1 alpha
(c) 2019 SillyBits


'Satisfactory Savegame Tool NG' allows for numerous options regarding satisfactory 
savegames, e.g. searching and erasing damaged entities.

This is a complete C#/C++ port of former 'Satisfactory Savegame Checker' which had
lousy performance due to being implemented in pure Python.
It's open source and available for free at 
https://github.com/SillyBits/satisfactory-savegame-tool-ng/.
You can also get ready-made executables in the download section at 
https://www.satisfactory-forum.de.


Credits to bitowl, S4XXX, Goz3rr and Vilsol for their work on deciphering the 
structure of satisfactory savegames.
Also thanks to Panossa for doing the graphics, and to RapierTropf for helping out
on those german translations.


Cheers, and always remember:

We do not waste
... so why waste a broken save if you can fix it :D
