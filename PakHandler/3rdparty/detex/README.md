# detex
Low-level library that can be used to decompress textures and texture blocks compressed using formats such as BC1/DXT1/S3TC, BC2-BC3, BC4/RGTC1, BC5/RGTC2, BC6 (BPTC_FLOAT), BC7 (BPTC), ETC1 and the ETC2 family.

It includes flexible pixel format conversion functions between a variety of formats, including several uncompressed formats and mapping HDR textures.

Additionally, loading and saving of KTX and DDS texture files is supported.

Included is a simple texture file viewer program as well as a command line utility to convert between texture file formats.

It has been developed using Linux, but is probably usable on other platforms without too much effort.
